int redPin = 9: This line defines the redPin as 9, which is the pin that will be used to control the red LED.

int greenPin = 10: This line defines the greenPin as 10, which is the pin that will be used to control the green LED.

int bluePin = 11: This line defines the bluePin as 11, which is the pin that will be used to control the blue LED.

pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT): This function sets the specified redPin as an output.

pinMode(greenPin, OUTPUT): This function sets the specified greenPin as an output.

pinMode(bluePin, OUTPUT): This function sets the specified bluePin as an output.

digitalWrite(redPin, HIGH): This function sets the redPin to a high state, which turns on the red LED.

digitalWrite(greenPin, LOW): This function sets the greenPin to a low state, which turns off the green LED.

digitalWrite(bluePin, LOW): This function sets the bluePin to a low state, which turns off the blue LED.

delay(1000): This function causes the program to wait for 1000 milliseconds.

The same steps are repeated for the other colors. The different combinations of HIGH and LOW on the redPin, greenPin, 
and bluePin control the different colors of the RGB LED
