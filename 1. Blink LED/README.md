1. void setup(): This is the setup function, where we configure the initial settings for the Arduino board. In this code, we use the pinMode function to set the pin 13 as an output.

```python
void setup()
```

2. pinMode(13, OUTPUT): This function sets the specified pin as an output. In this case, we are using pin 13 as an output for the LED.

3. void loop(): This is the main loop of the code, where the program continuously runs until the board is powered off.

4. digitalWrite(13, HIGH): This function turns on the LED connected to pin 13. The HIGH value means that the pin is set to 5 volts, which is the same as turning on the LED.

5. delay(1000): This function causes the program to wait for 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

6. digitalWrite(13, LOW): This function turns off the LED connected to pin 13. The LOW value means that the pin is set to 0 volts, which is the same as turning off the LED.

7. The code then repeats the process, turning the LED on and off continuously with 1 second delays in between each change.

```python
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT); // set pin 13 as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // turn on the LED
  delay(1000); // wait for 1 second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW); // turn off the LED
  delay(1000); // wait for 1 second
}
```
